Kanau is an educational web app to aid knowledge retention for Japanese learners through the presentation of flashcards. The review interval of these flashcards are calculated based on how well a user remembers them. It also contains a self-hosted Japanese Dictionary, complete with sample sentences and an easy add-to-card feature.
